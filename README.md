Spyware Guard

Spyware Guard is a lightweight Python script designed to monitor and protect your system from spyware. It detects suspicious processes in real time, terminates them, and quarantines malicious files to prevent further harm.

Features

	•	Real-time monitoring of processes.
	•	Detection of known spyware based on a configurable list.
	•	Automatic termination of suspicious processes.
	•	Quarantining of identified malicious files.
	•	Logging of security events for further analysis.

Requirements

	•	Python 3.7 or higher
	•	Dependencies:
	•	psutil

Installation

	1.	Clone or Download the Repository
Download the script and place it in a secure folder on your machine.
	2.	Install Dependencies
Use pip to install the required libraries:

pip install psutil


	3.	Run the Script
Execute the script directly:

python spyware_guard.py



Configuration

	•	Suspicious Processes List:
Update the SUSPICIOUS_PROCESSES list in the script to include processes that you want to monitor:

SUSPICIOUS_PROCESSES = ['keylogger.exe', 'malicious.exe', 'spywaretool']


	•	Quarantine Directory:
The script will move suspicious files to a quarantine folder in the current working directory. Ensure this folder has the necessary permissions.

Usage

	1.	Start the script:

python spyware_guard.py


	2.	Monitor the console output for alerts about suspicious activity.
	3.	Check the security_log.txt file for detailed logs.

Output

Example Console Output:

Starting spyware detection...
Suspicious process detected: keylogger.exe
Quarantined: C:\malware\keylogger.exe

Example Log File (security_log.txt):

2024-12-04 14:32:15 - Suspicious process detected: keylogger.exe (PID: 1234)
2024-12-04 14:32:15 - Quarantined file: C:\malware\keylogger.exe

Limitations

	•	This script is a basic implementation and is not a replacement for a full-fledged antivirus or anti-spyware solution.
	•	The suspicious processes list must be updated manually to include new threats.
	•	Requires administrative privileges to terminate some processes or quarantine files.
